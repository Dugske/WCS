# Introduction  

**WCS** is a handy framework that provides **useful abstraction** for your combat systems.
It allows you to create **any kind** of combat system with **ease**, providing tools and covering basic and tedious stuff, like *replication*,
*skill creation*, *side effects*, *requests to server*.

## Getting Started

**WCS** is made utilizing **[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)** and compiled to luau using **[roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/)**. It provides support for
[roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) users and [luau](https://luau-lang.org/) users,
by providing type definitions for both languages.

But the usage may differ depending on the language you use, as some utility tools were exported specifically for luau users,
the main differences are listed [on this page](./extras//differences.md).

### TypeScript Template
If you are familiar with *[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)*, it might be worth looking at [a template](https://github.com/g1mmethemoney/WCS-Example),
made specifically for [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) usage.
 - [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) Template is not currently planned.
